        <p>This animation was written entirely in vanilla JS using P5. There are three pieces to the animation: the
            lighthouse lamp, a tiny sailboat in the distance, and the undulating waves.</p>
        <p>The waves are created using a combination of sine functions to generate the up-and-down motion and are all
            different by varying amplitudes and wavelengths, representing different wave layers in the ocean. Each wave
            is animated to move at its own pace, using speed variables that alter their phase over time.</p>
